Wickham opens by advocating for open-mindedness in statistics - what is canonical and "right" should not be clung to dogmatically. He expresses the need for grammars of data analysis that will make work in the field smarter. These grammars, he says, must be embedded in programming languages - arriving at the logical conclusion that statistics students must be taught to program. Wickham advises that this can start as early as the first statistics course if it is done in a way that will not overwhelm the fledgling statisticians.
