Wickham (2015) summary

Wickham (2015) wrote about the importance of practicing "safe-stats." Educators must encourage students to venture into statistical analysis and provide them with the tools they need to succeed early on in their undergraduate careers. He suggested that the statistics curriculum for undergraduate students be revised to include programmimg. The ability to code enables the students' development in data analysis.
