Summary of Wickham (2015)
=========================

Statistics curricula have traditionally made statistics inaccesible to students 
and amateurs or researchers in other fields. Wickham believes it's time to make 
statistics more accesible by providing students with progamming skills and 
developing grammars of data analysis. A grammar is a framework that lays out the 
minimal set of independent components and a way of joining them to solve a wide 
range of problems. The best grammars are both flexible and constraining.
