Teaching Safe-Stats, Not Statistical Abstience  
==============================================
Wickham (2015)  

Wickham suggests that statistics is at risk of becoming obsolete due to the stigmatization of amateur statistics. However, this problem can be reduced if the correct tools are provided, preferably in the first statistics course someone takes. According to Wickham, the key is to provide statisticians with a flexible and constraining grammar of data analysis within the framework of a programming language. Wickham emphasizes that promoting safer-stats is better than statistical abstience.
