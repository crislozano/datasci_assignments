Like teaching swimming (or sex ed), nobody can be expected to only rely on statisticians when they want to do statistics, so teaching some basics is necessary in order for accurate analysis to take place. It is important to give students the skills and tools they need to learn correct statistical analysis methods. Two important aspects of statistics education include data analysis grammars and learning programming. Students can begin to learn programming by using code "recipes" that immediately show how they are useful.
