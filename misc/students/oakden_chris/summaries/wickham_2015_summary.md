In the article, Hadley Wickham identifies problems with how statistics is taught; it seems that people are discouraged from incorporating statistics into their work unless they are experts, or have access to an expert. To help remedy this issue, the author proposes the development of what he calls grammars of data analysis. This approach seems to call for incorporating programming techniques in the development of a tool kit for data analysis. When done right, this approach will equip students with effective methods to tackle a variety of statistical problems.
