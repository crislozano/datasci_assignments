Summary

Wickham thinks that instead of sticking to abstinence based approaches to statistics, people should offer some good tools to make it safer, and the undergraduate statistics curriculum is an important place to teach safe-stats. Developing grammars of data analysis is one of the keys to teach safe-stats, and  the best grammars should be both flexible and constraining. The former can be achieved by embedding the grammar in a programming language. Therefore, it is good to teach programming in even the earliest statistics course, and the key point is to focus on immediate pay-offs.
