# Teaching Safe-Stats, Not Statistical Abstinence

## Wickham (2015) summary

Four sentence summary goes here. 

Statistics should be made fun and safe for it to remain relevant and approachable to everyone. As such, developing and teaching data analysis grammars is one good way to achieve this goal. Since the grammars need to offer the freedom of flexibility and be constrained in a way that prevents them from overgenerating, programming seems to be the way to go. In fact, the least we can do to prepare our students for the overwelming world of data is to teach them programming; and do so in a way that rewards them and exponentially grows in difficulty.
